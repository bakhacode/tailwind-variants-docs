# Tailwind v4

TailwindCSS v4 is now available! You can use all the new features and improvements from `Tailwindcss v4` in your projects.

Upgrade `tailwind-variants` to `v1.x` to use it.

### Migration Steps

To upgrade your project to `v1.x`, you can run the upgrade script.

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
  <Tab>

    ```bash copy
    npm install tailwind-variants@latest
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

    ```bash copy
    yarn upgrade tailwind-variants@latest
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

    ```bash copy
    pnpm upgrade tailwind-variants@latest
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Breaking changes

- The `responsiveVariants` option has been removed.
- `withTv` has been removed.

> ❕ Note: `Tailwindcss v4` no longer supports the `config.content.transform` so we remove the `responsiveVariants` feature
> 
> If you want to use `responsiveVariants`, you need to add it manually to your classname.
>
> e.g. `className="sm:text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg"` more info [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design).
